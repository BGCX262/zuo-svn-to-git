== Introduction ==

The objective of this project is to emulate the official [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Global_Terminal GTS] using PHP. In order for this to happen the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS NDS] must be configured to connect to a alternative [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System DNS] server, thus allowing it to redirect the GTS specific traffic to our own website.


== Details ==

The website has been developed at the following circumstances:
  * Apache 2.2.14.0
  * PHP 5.3.1.0
  * MySQL 5.1.41.0
_I used xampp on Windows 7 and NetBeans 6.2 (with PHP module) to do this, but this does not mean that it is a Windows only application, you could in fact apply the website service (and DNS [http://www.python.org/ Python] script) on a Mac, Linux or other OS by modifying some [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_path relative paths]. These are usually small things that are different among many OS but that may break the site if not configured properly._
